            <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
            <p>Global warming is the event of the earth's average temerature rising. In the last century, the earth's
                temperature rised by an average 1°C. It my not sound much but it can have a huge effect in the future.
                By the 21st century, scientists predict the earth's teperature to rise by 2-5°C. This kind of
                temperature will lead to more rainfall, unpredictable seasons and cause the glaciers to melt, making the
                sea-level to rise.</p>

            <h3>Causes of Global Warming</h3>
            <p>What causes global warming? Well, the main cause of global warming is called the greenhouse effect. Since
                the industral revoulution, humans have been burning a large amount of fossil fuels, such as oil and gas,
                producing large amounts of carbon dioxide. The gasses released into the atmosphere, blanket the globe
                and warm the earth. This is called the Greenhouse effect.<br><br> Deforestation is another huge reason
                for global warming. The trees absorb the carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Unfortunately, humans are
                cutting down the rainforests to make furniture, paper, clear the way for the roads and etc. Because of
                the decrease of the forests and trees, the carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere. <br><br> The Earth
                receives its warmth from the sun, so it's reasonable to suspect that our home star may be one of the
                reasons for global warming. Although the amount of energy coming from the sun does vary and may have
                been responsible for warming in the past, however, NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC) have ruled this out as a cause of the current warming trend. The average energy coming
                from the sun generally has remained constant since 1750, and the warming does not occur uniformly
                throughout the atmosphere. The upper layer is actually cooling as the bottom layer becomes warmer.</p>

                <h4>Consequences of Global Warming</h4>
                <p>Global warming may make some regions more hospitable for longer periods. However, it probably will result in longer, more intense heat waves in the warmer spots of the world. It also may trigger natural disasters, including floods, hurricanes and drought. Increased precipitation and temperatures in certain areas could encourage the breeding of disease-carrying pests, such as mosquitoes. Greater heat also may increase the production of ground-level ozone, a pollutant which can damage your lungs.

                <h5>How To Prevent Global Warming</h5>
                <p>We can stop global warming by stop using fossil fuels and use renewable energy.
                    Solar panels are made up of
                    solar cells that trap the heat from the sun and convert it into energy. Wind turbines are towers that
                    use the kinetic energy from the wind to generate power. Geothermal energy utilizes the heat from inside
                    the earth. <br><br> Government research and development programs, such as the Advanced Research Project
                    Agency-Energy, can drive progress in clean energy technologies and bring them to commercial use.
                    <br><br> You can make a difference by using less energy at home. You can carpool, bicycle,
                    walk or jog
                    to your destination. Save power at home by taking shorter showers, turning off the water while brushing
                    your teeth, turning off lights when they are not in use, hanging laundry outside to dry and unplugging
                    electronics when they are not being used.
