            <h2>Melting Glaciers and Interconnectedness</h2>
            <p>To see how deeply interconnected the planet truly is look no further than the massive ice sheets on the
                Northern Hemisphere and South Pole. <br><br> The analysis, published in Nature, shows for the first time
                that changes in the Antarctic ice sheet were caused by the melting of ice sheets in the Northern
                Hemisphere. The influence was driven by sea-level changes caused by the melting ice in the north during
                the past 40,000 years. Understanding how this works can help climate scientists grasp future changes and
                instability as global warming increases the melting of major ice sheets and ice caps <br><br> The study
                models how this seesaw effect works. They found that when ice on the Northern Hemisphere stayed frozen
                during the last peak of the Ice Age, about 20,000 to 26,000 years ago, it led to reduced sea-levels in
                Antarctica and a growth of the ice sheet there. When the climate warmed after that peak, the ice sheets
                in the north started melting, causing sea-levels in the southern hemisphere to rise. This rising ocean
                triggered the ice in Antarctica to retreat quickly to about the size it is today over thousands of
                years.</p>

            <h3>Glacier Melting</h3>
            <p>Glaciers that exist today are remnants of the last ice age. Thick sheets of ice advanced and retreated
                across most continents several times before withdrawing to the polar regions about 10,000 years ago.
                Continent-scale ice sheets still cover Greenland and Antarctica, while smaller ice caps and glaciers
                retreated to the world's high latitudes and mountains.<br><br>Glaciers gain mass through snowfall and
                lose mass through melting and sublimation (when water evaporates directly from solid ice). Glaciers that
                terminate in a lake or the ocean also lose mass through iceberg calving. <br><br> To see if a glacier is
                growing or shrinking, glaciologists check the condition of snow and ice at several locations on the
                glacier at the end of the melt season. The scientists check snow levels against stakes theyâ€™ve inserted
                in the glacier, dig snow pits in the surface to examine the sequence of seasonal layers, and insert long
                poles into the glacier to probe characteristics of the snow and ice.</p>

            <h4>How To Stop Glaciers From Melting</h4>
            <p>The galciers are mainly melting because of global warming. For more information about global warming,
                read the artical.
                Glaciers melt naturally, but in the usual course of things are also restored by additional snowfall.
                Because rapid glacial melting is caused by global warming, you'd have to slow or stop global warming in
                order to stop the melt. <br><br> We can stop global warming by stop using fossil fuels and use renewable
                energy.
                Solar panels are made up of
                solar cells that trap the heat from the sun and convert it into energy. Wind turbines are towers that
                use the kinetic energy from the wind to generate power. Geothermal energy utilizes the heat from inside
                the earth. <br><br> You can make a difference by using less energy at home. You can carpool, bicycle,
                walk or jog
                to your destination. Save power at home by taking shorter showers, turning off the water while brushing
                your teeth, turning off lights when they are not in use, hanging laundry outside to dry and unplugging
                electronics when they are not being used.</p>
